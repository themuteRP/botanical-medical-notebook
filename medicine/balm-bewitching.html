    <h2>Bewitching Balm</h2>
	<p class="i">Balm</p>
	<p>Treats head trauma (it will also keep you from falling under the spell of a witch - or take you on a journey inside your head)</p>
	<p>Add 8 cups of water to a cold cauldron or pot. Add 2 cups of violet snowdrop and 10 drops of opium or morphine. Stir well.<br>
	Add 1 part wax, 1 part oil, 1 tablespoon of salt to the mixture.<br>
	Leave in a warm room stirring frequently (every hour or so). Alternatively put over a very low heat.<br>
	Once the wax has dissolved and the only solids are the snowdrops - strain and put in to vessels.<br>
	Leave in a cool place until the mixture hardens, then secure a lid.</p>
	<p>Apply a small amount to the top of the neck. <b>APPLYING TOO MUCH WILL CAUSE YOU TO GO ON A SPIRITUAL JOURNEY. ONLY DO SO UNDER GUIDANCE.</b></p>
