		<h3>Preface</h3>
		<p><i><b>The information contained within is strictly confidential.</b> If you are reading this and are not a government official or a licensed medical practioner then please return this book to the St. Denis Doctors Office, St. Denis, LE at your earliest convenience.</i></p>
		<p>This is a collection of notes I have taken from observations, books, sketches I have made, and photos I have taken or acquired while doing my research in The New Territories.</p>
		<p>I have found many new plants I have not encountered while living in Éire. Any and all plants I encounter in the New Territories will be catalogued in this book.</p>
		<p>With the use of office pharmaceutical/apothecary equipment and apparatus I have produced several medicines using locally sourced plants, chemicals and materials. This will benefit the New Territories as we will not have to outsource or order from elsewhere.</p>
		<p>All information is correct at the time of publishing. Any usage of misinformation gained from the pages within this book are at your own discretion.<br>
		<i>For rectifications please speak to <b>Head Pharmacist Einín Springs, Pharmacie T.N.T., St. Denis, LE</b>.</i>
		Erroneus information will be amended upon the next publication.
