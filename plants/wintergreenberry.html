    <h2>Wintergreen Berry:</h2>
	<p class="i">Gaultheria Procumbens</p>
	<p>Growth<br>
	The comparatively slow-growing and long-lived shrubs have a prostrate habit and reach heights of 5 to 20 centimetres. The main growing season is from spring to fall. The plants usually grow to a width of 20 to 50 centimetres.</p>

	<p>Leaves<br>
	Gaultheria procumbens is evergreen. The dark-green, simple leaves are alternate. They are obovate, serrulate and petiolate. The foliage is dense and turns an attractive dark red in autumn. The leaves have a leathery surface.</p>

	<p>Flowers and Fruits<br>
	Gaultheria procumbens produces showy clusters of fragrant, white pitcher-shaped flowers in July and August. The plants flower on last years shoots.<br>
	In summer and autumn the shrubs produce only few ornamental, edible red loculicidal capsules that are persistent on the plant.</p>

	<p>Root system<br>
	The plants form shallow roots.

	<p>Distribution<br>
	Gaultheria procumbens is native to East Canada, the central Northeast of the US, the Northeast of the US and the Southeast of the US.</p>

	<p>Cultivation<br>
	Location and general conditions<br>
	The shrubs prefer a half-shady situation on moist soil. The substrate should be peaty and comparatively poor with a pH between 4 and 6,5. The plants need a soil depth of at least 30 centimetres for good growth. The plants tolerate temperatures down to -29Â°C and need a frost-free period of at least 17 weeks.<br>
	Classification after Prof. Dr. Sieber<br>
	woodland bordes (soil usually rich in humus)<br>
	Tolerance of special soil conditions<br>
	none: anaerobic soil, soil salinity<br>
	low: calcareous soil<br>
	high: drought</p>

	<p>Maintenance<br>
	The plants need little to no maintenance if grown under suitable conditions.

	<p>Propagation<br>
	Propagate by sowing (the seeds require vernalization) or by cuttings.</p>

	<p>Pests and diseases<br>
	Leaf blotches are a sign of a fungal or bacterial infection. Bacterial spots are rather angular and yellow-rimmed while fungal spots usually are rather rounded with an area of fruiting bodies. Destroy affected parts, additionaly apply fungizide it is is a fungal infection.<br>
	Irregular swelling, so-called 'galls', may be caused by insects, mites, fungi or bacteria. Destroy affected parts. To prevent infection avoid injuring the plants and improve drainage.<br>
	A powdery white coat on the plants indicates an infection with powdery mildew. Remove affected plants and apply a fungicide. To prevent infection improve ventilation, keep the roots moist and do not water the plants from above.<br>
	White tufts or white covering on the lower surface of the leaves indicates an infection with downy mildew. Remove affected plants and apply a fungicide. To prevent infection improve ventilation, keep the roots moist and do not water the plants from above. </p>
