    <h2>Wintergreen Berry:</h2>
	<p class="i">Gaultheria Procumbens</p>
	<p>Growth
	The comparatively slow-growing and long-lived shrubs have a prostrate habit and reach heights of 5 to 20 centimetres. The main growing season is from spring to fall. The plants usually grow to a width of 20 to 50 centimetres.

	Leaves
	Gaultheria procumbens is evergreen. The dark-green, simple leaves are alternate. They are obovate, serrulate and petiolate. The foliage is dense and turns an attractive dark red in autumn. The leaves have a leathery surface.

	Flowers and Fruits
	Gaultheria procumbens produces showy clusters of fragrant, white pitcher-shaped flowers in July and August. The plants flower on last years shoots.
	In summer and autumn the shrubs produce only few ornamental, edible red loculicidal capsules that are persistent on the plant.

	Root system
	The plants form shallow roots.

	Distribution
	Gaultheria procumbens is native to East Canada, the central Northeast of the US, the Northeast of the US and the Southeast of the US.

	Cultivation
	Location and general conditions
	The shrubs prefer a half-shady situation on moist soil. The substrate should be peaty and comparatively poor with a pH between 4 and 6,5. The plants need a soil depth of at least 30 centimetres for good growth. The plants tolerate temperatures down to -29Â°C and need a frost-free period of at least 17 weeks.
	Classification after Prof. Dr. Sieber
	woodland bordes (soil usually rich in humus)
	Tolerance of special soil conditions
	none: anaerobic soil, soil salinity
	low: calcareous soil
	high: drought

	Maintenance
	The plants need little to no maintenance if grown under suitable conditions.

	Propagation
	Propagate by sowing (the seeds require vernalization) or by cuttings.

	Pests and diseases
	Leaf blotches are a sign of a fungal or bacterial infection. Bacterial spots are rather angular and yellow-rimmed while fungal spots usually are rather rounded with an area of fruiting bodies. Destroy affected parts, additionaly apply fungizide it is is a fungal infection.

	Irregular swelling, so-called 'galls', may be caused by insects, mites, fungi or bacteria. Destroy affected parts. To prevent infection avoid injuring the plants and improve drainage.

	A powdery white coat on the plants indicates an infection with powdery mildew. Remove affected plants and apply a fungicide. To prevent infection improve ventilation, keep the roots moist and do not water the plants from above.

	White tufts or white covering on the lower surface of the leaves indicates an infection with downy mildew. Remove affected plants and apply a fungicide. To prevent infection improve ventilation, keep the roots moist and do not water the plants from above. </p>
