    <h2>Wisteria:</h2>
	<p class="i">Wisteria frutescens</p>
	
	<p>Growth<br>
	A woody, deciduous, perennial climbing vine growing up to 15 m long over many supports via powerful counterclockwise-twining stems.</p>

	<p>Leaves<br>
	The foliage consists of shiny, dark-green, pinnately compound leaves 10–30cm in length. The leaves bear 9-15 oblong leaflets that are each 2–6cm long.</p>

	<p>Flowers and Fruits<br>
	bears unscented bluish-purple flowers in racemes 15–30cm long, a generally average length for the Wisteria family.<br>
	It bears numerous poisonous, bean-like seed pods 5–10cm long that mature in summer and persist until winter; the pods are fuzzy and greenish-tan when young, but shiny brown and smooth when dry. The seeds are large and brown.</p>

	<p>Cultivation<br>
	Location and general conditions<br>
	Prefers moist soils. It is considered shade tolerant, but will flower only when exposed to partial or full sun.
	</p>

	<p>Pests and diseases<br>
	Subject to damage by typical pests like aphids, leaf miners, beetles, scale insects, and mealybugs. Pests of particular concern are longhorn beetles, such as Synaphaeta guexi, and the Asian long-horned beetle. These beetles will bore into the woody stems of young or unhealthy wisteria, causing disruption of water and nutrient flow. This also allows for the potential to introduce disease, like rot, and both of these have the potential to cause death of the plant.</p>

	<p>Toxicity<br>
	It is toxic to people, horses, cats and dogs.</p>
