    <h2>Black Pepper:</h2>
	<p class="i">Piper Nigrum</p>
	<p>Growth<br>
	The climbers reach heights of 3 to 4 metres.</p>

	<p>Leaves<br>
	Piper nigrum is evergreen. The dark-green, simple leaves are alternate. They are ovate, entire and petiolate.</p>

	<p>Flowers and Fruits<br>
	Piper nigrum produces spikes of white flowers from June to August.<br>
	The climbers carry red drupes that are both edible and ornamental.</p>

	<p>Distribution<br>
	Piper nigrum is native to Southeast Asia.</p>

	<p>Cultivation<br>
	Location and general conditions<br>
	The climbers prefer a sunny situation on moderately moist soil. The substrate should be sandy loam. The plants tolerate temperatures only above at least 1°C.The plants are suited for cultivation in a hot house, growing the plants outdoors is only possible in tropical climates.</p>

	<p>Maintenance<br>
	The plants usually require only a moderate amount of maintenance.<br>
	Lightly cut back late in winter as necessary.<br>
	Water moderately in summer. Give only little water in winter.</p>

	<p>Fertilization<br>
	Apply a compound fertilizer monthly during growth.</p>

	<p>Propagation<br>
	Propagate by sowing in early spring (at 20°C) or by semi-ripe cuttings in summer.</p>

	<p>Pests and diseases<br>
	Sievelike holes in the leaves are a sign of an infestation with flea beetles. Prevent infestation by using vegetable mesh.<br>
	Small dark-coloured beetles feeding on the plants are very likely weevils. Their larvae feed on seedling, cuttings, roots and tubers. Handpick and destroy pests and improve hygiene. Additionaly use insecticide or biological control (nematodes). </p>
