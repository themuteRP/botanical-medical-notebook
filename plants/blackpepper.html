	Distribution
	Piper nigrum is native to Southeast Asia.

	Cultivation
	Location and general conditions
	The climbers prefer a sunny situation on moderately moist soil. The substrate should be sandy loam. The plants tolerate temperatures only above at least 1°C.The plants are suited for cultivation in a hot house, growing the plants outdoors is only possible in tropical climates.

	Maintenance
	The plants usually require only a moderate amount of maintenance.
	Lightly cut back late in winter as necessary.
	Water moderately in summer. Give only little water in winter.

	Fertilization
	Apply a compound fertilizer monthly during growth.

	Propagation
	Propagate by sowing in early spring (at 20°C) or by semi-ripe cuttings in summer.

	Pests and diseases
	Sievelike holes in the leaves are a sign of an infestation with flea beetles. Prevent infestation by using vegetable mesh.

	Small dark-coloured beetles feeding on the plants are very likely weevils. Their larvae feed on seedling, cuttings, roots and tubers. Handpick and destroy pests and improve hygiene. Additionaly use insecticide or biological control (nematodes). </p>
