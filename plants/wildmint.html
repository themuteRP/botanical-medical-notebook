	<p class="i">Mentha Arvensis</p>
	
	<p>Growth<br>
	The comparatively short-lived perennials reach heights of 15 to 50 centimetres, they have a erect habit. The main growing season is in spring.</p>

	<p>Leaves<br>
	Mentha arvensis is deciduous. The middle-green, simple leaves are opposite. They are ovate, serrulate and petiolate. The foliage is porous.</p>

	<p>Flowers and Fruits<br>
	Mentha arvensis produces showy clusters of fragrant, pale purplish pink labiate flowers from July to September.<br>
	The perennials produce brown schizocarps in summer and autumn.</p>

	<p>Root system<br>
	</p>

	<p>Distribution<br>
	Mentha arvensis is native to all of Europe, Turkey, the Caucasus, West Sibiria, East Sibiria, Sakhalin, the Kamtschatka Peninsula, Central Asia, the Himalaya, China, Alaska, Canada, the USA, the Philippines and New Zealand.</p>

	<p>Cultivation<br>
	Location and general conditions<br>
	The perennials prefer a sunny situation on moist soil. The substrate should be sandy-loamy and comparatively poor with a pH between 5 and 7. The plants need a soil depth of at least 15 centimetres for good growth. The plants tolerate temperatures down to -18Â°C and need a frost-free period of at least 14 weeks.<br>
	Classification after Prof. Dr. Sieber<br>
	open areas<br>
	Tolerance of special soil conditions<br>
	none: soil salinity<br>
	low: drought<br>
	medium: anaerobic soil, calcareous soil</p>

	<p>Propagation<br>
	Propagate by sowing seeds in a cold frame in spring, by tip cuttings in spring or in summer or by division in spring or in autumn.</p>

	<p>Pests and diseases<br>
	A powdery white coat on the plants indicates an infection with powdery mildew. Remove affected plants and apply a fungicide. To prevent infection improve ventilation, keep the roots moist and do not water the plants from above.<br>
	Brown, orange or yellowish pustules on shoots and on the leaves lower surfaces are very likely caused by a fungal infestation (rust). Remove affected parts and apply fungicide. Also improve ventilation and reduce humidity.</p>
