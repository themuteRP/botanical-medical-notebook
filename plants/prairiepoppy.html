    <h2>Prairie Poppy:</h2>
	<p class="i">Eschscholzia Californica</p>
	<p>Growth<br>
	The comparatively short-lived plants have a erect habit and reach heights of 5 to 60 centimetres. The main growing season is from spring to fall. The plants usually grow to a width of 10 to 30 centimetres.</p>

	<p>Leaves<br>
	Eschscholzia californica has middle-green, simple leaves that are alternate. The leaves are pinnatifid, lobate and petiolate. The leaves have a glabrous surface.</p>

	<p>Flowers and Fruits<br>
	Eschscholzia californica produces cymes of showy, strong orange cruciform flowers from June to October.<br>
	The plants produce an abundance of brown fruits in summer.</p>

	<p>Distribution<br>
	Eschscholzia californica is native to Oregon, California and Western Europe.</p>

	<p>Cultivation<br>
	Location and general conditions<br>
	The plants prefer a sunny situation on dry to moderately moist soil. The substrate should be gritty-sandy and comparatively poor with a pH between 5,8 and 7,5. The plants need a soil depth of at least 25 centimetres for good growth. The plants tolerate temperatures down to -23Â°C and need a frost-free period of at least 17 weeks.<br>
	Tolerance of special soil conditions<br>
	none: soil salinity<br>
	medium: anaerobic soil, drought, calcareous soil</p>

	<p>Maintenance<br>
	The plants need little to no maintenance if grown under suitable conditions.</p>

	<p>Propagation<br>
	Propagate by sowing.</p>

	<p>Pests and diseases<br>
	Leaf blotches are a sign of a fungal or bacterial infection. Bacterial spots are rather angular and yellow-rimmed while fungal spots usually are rather rounded with an area of fruiting bodies. Destroy affected parts, additionaly apply fungizide it is is a fungal infection.</p>

	<p>Sudden wilting and pale green discolouration indicate a fungal infection (phytophthora). Remove infected plants. Avoid by improving drainage and over-fertilization. </p>
