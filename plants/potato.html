    <h2>Potato:</h2>
	<p class="i">Solanum Tuberosum</p>
	
	<p>Growth<br>
	The potato is a herbaceous perennial that can grow to about 60cm in height. </p>

	<p>Leaves<br>
	The compound leaves are spirally arranged; each leaf is 20â€“30cm long and consists of a terminal leaflet and two to four pairs of leaflets.</p>

	<p>Flowers and Fruits<br>
	The white, pink, lavender, or purple flowers have five fused petals and yellow stamens. The fruit is a small poisonous berry with numerous seeds.</p>

	<p>Root system<br>
	The stems extend underground into structures called stolons. The ends of the stolons may enlarge greatly to form a few to more than 20 tubers, of variable shape and size, usually ranging in weight up to 300 grams (10 ounces) but occasionally to more than 1.5 kg (3.3 pounds). The skin varies in colour from brownish white to deep purple; the starchy flesh normally ranges in colour from white to yellow, but it too may be purple.</p>

	<p>Distribution<br>
	The potato is native to the South American Andes and is one of the world's main food crops. They were largely cultivated in South America by the Incas thousands of years ago. Encountered by Spanish, potatoes were introduced in to Europe during the second half of the 1700s.</p>

	<p>Cultivation<br>
	Local and general conditions<br>
	The potato is frost tender.<br>
	They will produce the best crop when planted in a light, loose, well-drained soil. They require the full sun on them. Potatoes prefer a slightly acidic and moist soil.</p>

	<p>Propagation<br>
	Plants grown from seeds show wide variations, while tuber-propagated plants are clones of the parent plant.<br>
	Seed propagation is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, and the resultant progenies have poor vigor and lower yields.<br>
	For propagation, tubers are cut into pieces with at least one or two eyes (seed tubers) before planting. Each section sprouts and develops into a new plant.</p>

	<p>Toxicity<br>
	Potatoes are highly toxic.<br>
	While potatoes are edibile if prepared correctly, green potatoes indicate that the potato is no longer edible.</p>
