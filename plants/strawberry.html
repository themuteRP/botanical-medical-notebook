	<p class="i">Fragaria X Ananassa</p>
	<p>Growth<br>
	The comparatively fast-growing perennials have a mat-forming habit and reach heights of 10 to 40 centimetres. The plants usually grow to a width of 30 to 60 centimetres.</p>

	<p>Leaves<br>
	Fragaria x ananassa is deciduous. The grey-green, ternate leaves are alternate. The obovate leaflets are serrulate and petiolate. They turn an attractive red in autumn. The leaves have a glabrous surface.</p>

	<p>Flowers and Fruits<br>
	Fragaria x ananassa produces cymes of fragrant, white five-stellate flowers in May and June.<br>
	The perennials produce red accessory fruits in summer and autumn.</p>

	<p>Distribution<br>
	Fragaria x ananassa is native to : garden origin.</p>

	<p>Cultivation<br>
	Location and general conditions<br>
	The perennials prefer a sunny to half-shady situation on moist soil. The substrate should be sandy loam. The plants tolerate temperatures down to -29Â°C.<br>
	Tolerance of special soil conditions<br>
	high: city climate</p>

	<p>Maintenance<br>
	The plants usually require only a moderate amount of maintenance.</p>

	<p>Pests and diseases<br>
	Honeydew, galls and distorted leaves are a sign for an infestation with aphids. Use an insecticide or control biologically, e.g. with parasitic wasps or predators such as Aphidoletes aphidimyza.<br>
	Leaf blotches are a sign of a fungal or bacterial infection. Bacterial spots are rather angular and yellow-rimmed while fungal spots usually are rather rounded with an area of fruiting bodies. Destroy affected parts, additionaly apply fungizide it is is a fungal infection.<br>
	A powdery white coat on the plants indicates an infection with powdery mildew. Remove affected plants and apply a fungicide. To prevent infection improve ventilation, keep the roots moist and do not water the plants from above.<br>
	White tufts or white covering on the lower surface of the leaves indicates an infection with downy mildew. Remove affected plants and apply a fungicide. To prevent infection improve ventilation, keep the roots moist and do not water the plants from above.<br>
	Fine webs on the plants indicate an infestation with red spider mites. These sap-sucking insects mainly appear under glass and can be controlled either with insecticide or biologically with parasitic mites.<br>
	White spots on flowers and leaves in combination with buds that do not open indicate an infestation with thrips. These insects can be controlled by improving ventilation and by watering regularly as well as by using an insecticide or biolocial pest control (predatory mites).</p>
